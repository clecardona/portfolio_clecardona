        I use Javascript and  React to create simple,clean and responsive  web applications.<br/>
        Every user should enjoy using the app or website. 
        Therefore, my focus is on providing a clean and intuitive user interface.

        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <hr className="backend"/>
        Trained in Java, I use Springboot and Hibernate for the backend.
        A simple and well-constructed backend will allow the application to be efficient and functional.

      <div className="skills-item philosophy" >
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <hr className="philosophy"/>

        Coming from the world of architecture,
        I place a lot of importance on functionality and user interaction.
        I can also bring my experience in design, coloring and complexity simplification.
        Design must be there to enhance functionality, never the other way around
