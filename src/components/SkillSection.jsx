        I use Javascript and  React to create simple reactive and clear web applications.<br/>
        A clear an intuitive UI is what I keep my focus on all the time.
        Every user should enjoy using the app or website.

        <hr className="backend"/>
        Educated to Java, I use Springboot and Hibernate for backend.
        A simple and well done backend will allow the application to be efficient and functionnal.

        <hr className="philosophy"/>

        Coming from the world of Architecture,
        I accord a lot of importance to functionality and user interaction.
        I can also bring my experience in design, coloring and simplification of complexity.
        The design should be there to sublim functionnality, this is my main point.
